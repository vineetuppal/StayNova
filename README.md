    aws.s3.access.key=// your aws s3 access key
    aws.s3.bucket-name=hotel-images-proj

    spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=100MB
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=100MB
    ```

6. Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Backend Overview

The backend exposes various REST APIs for handling user authentication, room management, and bookings. Below is an overview of the key APIs available:

#### **Authentication**

- **Register User**: 
    - `POST /auth/register`
    - Registers a new user with their details.

- **Login User**: 
    - `POST /auth/login`
    - Logs in a registered user and returns a JWT token for session management.

#### **Users**

- **Get All Users**: 
    - `GET /users/all`
    - Retrieves all registered users.

- **Get User Profile**: 
    - `GET /users/get-logged-in-profile-info`
    - Retrieves the profile of the logged-in user.

- **Get User by ID**: 
    - `GET /users/get-by-id/{userId}`
    - Retrieves a single user's profile by ID.

- **Delete User**: 
    - `DELETE /users/delete/{userId}`
    - Deletes a user from the system.

#### **Rooms**

- **Add Room**: 
    - `POST /rooms/add`
    - Adds a new room to the database.

- **Get All Available Rooms**: 
    - `GET /rooms/all-available-rooms`
    - Retrieves all available rooms.

- **Get Available Rooms by Date and Type**: 
    - `GET /rooms/available-rooms-by-date-and-type?checkInDate={checkInDate}&checkOutDate={checkOutDate}&roomType={roomType}`
    - Retrieves available rooms based on dates and room type.

- **Get Room Types**: 
    - `GET /rooms/types`
    - Retrieves all available room types.

- **Get Room by ID**: 
    - `GET /rooms/room-by-id/{roomId}`
    - Retrieves a specific room by its ID.

- **Delete Room**: 
    - `DELETE /rooms/delete/{roomId}`
    - Deletes a room by its ID.

- **Update Room**: 
    - `PUT /rooms/update/{roomId}`
    - Updates room details.

#### **Bookings**

- **Book Room**: 
    - `POST /bookings/book-room/{roomId}/{userId}`
    - Books a room for a user.

- **Get All Bookings**: 
    - `GET /bookings/all`
    - Retrieves all bookings.

- **Get Booking by Confirmation Code**: 
    - `GET /bookings/get-by-confirmation-code/{bookingCode}`
    - Retrieves a booking using the confirmation code.

- **Cancel Booking**: 
    - `DELETE /bookings/cancel/{bookingId}`
    - Cancels a user's booking.

### AWS S3 Integration for Room Images

The application uses AWS S3 for storing room images. When a user adds a room to the system, the room image is uploaded to the S3 bucket (`hotel-images-proj`). The backend uses the AWS SDK to handle the image upload process.

### Security

JWT Authentication is used to secure the application. Upon successful login, users receive a JWT token that must be included in the header of each request for authentication. The `Authorization` header is used to send the token in the following format:

### Frontend Overview

The frontend of the StayNova Hotel Booking System is built with **React.js**, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key features and components:

- **User Authentication**: The user can register, log in, and manage their profile. The authentication flow relies on JWT tokens to authenticate the userâ€™s sessions.
  
- **Room Management**: Users can view available rooms, check availability based on dates, and filter rooms by type.
  
- **Booking System**: Users can book available rooms. The booking functionality also allows users to cancel or view their existing bookings.

- **Admin Dashboard**: For users with an **Admin** role, the system provides functionality to manage rooms, users, and bookings. Admins can add, update, or delete rooms and also view a list of all users and their bookings.

#### Key Components of the Frontend:

1. **Login/Register Page**:
   - Forms for user login and registration.
   - Sends API requests to the backend for authentication and registration.

2. **Dashboard**:
   - After logging in, users are directed to the dashboard where they can see available rooms, their profile, and current bookings.
   - Admins have access to additional management functionalities.

3. **Room Listings**:
   - Displays a list of rooms with filters such as room type, check-in date, and check-out date.
   - Each room is shown with details and an image (stored in AWS S3).

4. **Booking Page**:
   - Allows users to make room bookings based on selected dates.
   - Sends booking data to the backend API to confirm the booking.

5. **Profile Management**:
   - Users can view and update their profile information.

6. **Admin Panel** (for admin users):
   - Allows admins to manage rooms, users, and bookings. Admins can add or remove rooms, update room details, and view user bookings.
  
## Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Gateway Integration**: Implement a **real-time payment gateway** integration for seamless booking and payment processing. This will provide users with instant feedback on payment success or failure, enhancing user experience during booking.

- **Concurrency and Multi-User Handling**: Enhance the backend to handle **high concurrency** with **thread-safe operations** and improved **database transaction management**. This will ensure the system performs well under heavy traffic, especially during peak booking times.

- **Real-Time Availability Updates**: Introduce **real-time room availability** updates using **WebSockets** or **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**, allowing users to see the most up-to-date room status without having to refresh the page.

- **Admin Panel Enhancements**: Expand the **Admin Panel** to include **real-time analytics** and **live updates** on bookings, revenue, and user activities, improving decision-making capabilities for hotel management.

- **User Activity Tracking and Personalization**: Incorporate a **user activity tracking system** to personalize the experience. Use real-time data to recommend rooms, promotions, and deals based on user behavior and preferences.

These future enhancements will help improve system performance, scalability, and the overall user experience.
